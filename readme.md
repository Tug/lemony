## üì¶ Included packages

-   `solito` for cross-platform navigation
-   `moti` for animations
-   `dripsy` for theming/design (you can bring your own, too)
-   Expo SDK 44
-   Next.js 12
-   React Navigation 6

## üóÇ Folder layout

-   `apps` entry points for each app

    -   `expo`
    -   `next`

-   `packages` shared packages across apps
    -   `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
        -   `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
        -   `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
        -   `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

-   Install dependencies: `yarn`

-   Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
    -   Runs `yarn next`
-   Expo local dev: `yarn native`
    -   Runs `expo start`

## üßë‚Äçüîß Build the app

-   For iOS: `yarn ios`

-   For Android: `yarn android`

## üì± Test the app
- Create a new account by signing up
- Edit your profile in the database using a tool like DBeaver:
  - Set your `role` to 'ADMIN'
  - Set your `kycStatus` to 'completed'

## Troubleshooting

### In simulator: `Disconnected from Metro (1001: "Stream end encountered")`

Restart the app. Press `i` for iOS or `a` for Android.

### Error when running `prisma generate`: `assertion failed [block != nullptr]: BasicBlock requested for unrecognized address`

Solution: start your shell with `arch -x86_64 zsh` (or `arch -x86_64 fish` if you're using fish)

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).
